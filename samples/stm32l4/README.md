  # Instructions
  * Download and install STM32CubeIDE.
  * File->Open Projects form File System, navigate to one of the samples, and select all projects in the list.
  * This board contains a sensors-demo in addition to the basic-sample. 
    The basic-sample project contains a simple example how to send data to IoTConnect.
    The sensor-demo contains integration with sensors from a very limited port 
    of the STM32CubeExpansion_Cloud_AZURE_V1.2.1 BSP.
  * When running/debugging, choose one of the demos form the project list first. Keep subdirectories selected, but unselect the actual stm32l4 sample directory.
