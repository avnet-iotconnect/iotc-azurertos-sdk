## Instructions
* Download and install MPLAB X IDE 5.45. IDE 5.40 has a known issue right now, so please use 5.35, or 5.45 and newer.
  * Download and install the MPLAB XC32/32++ Compiler 2.4.0 or later.
  (Buy the subscription for XC32 pro compiler if needs size optimization. OTA is dual bank updates so make sure that the program size is below half of the flash size.)
  * In MPLab, File > Open Project, navigate to the samples/same54xpro directory, select basic-sample, 
  check the "Open Required Projects" checkbox, and click the "Open Project" button.   
  * Plug in your board AFTER opening the project, so that MPLAB detects it
from the extracted zip file
